This portfolio is a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in web development and software engineering. It highlights key projects like my Discord clone,
Razorpay clone, e-commerce website, and Counter project. Designed with modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, the portfolio is fully responsive and
interactive, reflecting my commitment to clean, modular, and user-friendly design.
